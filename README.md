# SafiaÂ´s Amazing Internship

This repository records all of the work I did on my internship at NEAR DevHub in the DevRel Team.

## Register

- `19 May`: Install python 3.11 and `nearai`. Learn about different LLM models
- `20 May`: Create the first AI agents with `deepseek`, `llama` and other models
- `21 May`: Learn a bit about `github`, and keep creating agents 
- `23 May`: Finished testing models, mdels that didn't work: dobbyunhingedllama3_370bnew, flux1devfp8, flux1schnellfp8, llamaguard3_8b, qwen3_235ba2, r1_1776, srlfinetune0417debug
- `27 May`: We want to know which models speak French and Darija (l3arbia dyal lmaghrib). The models that speak French and Darija are: llama3p1_70binstruct, deepseekr1basic, llama4scoutinstructbasic, qwen2p5vl32binstruct

## Tasks

- My first task was to create agents using multiple models, and test them to see if they work.

- Current task: Add a `README.md` to all the agents, explaining who made the model, and what the model replies when you ask them what they are capable of

- Create a couple of questions to ask the AIs: "You are a tourist agent, and I want to make a trip to <France / Maghrib>. What would you recomend me to do in <city>, ..."

I made the questions: 
    - "..."
    - "..."

I wrote the answers in the `README.md` of each agent
