Now, let's plan your morning itinerary!

**Morning Attractions:**

For a 3-day trip, I'd recommend visiting some of London's iconic landmarks and popular attractions. Here are a few suggestions for the morning:

Day 1:
Start your day at **Buckingham Palace** (open from 9:30 am). Watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony, and then take a stroll through **St. James's Park**, one of London's oldest and most beautiful parks.

Day 2:
Visit the **British Museum** (open from 10 am), one of the world's greatest museums, featuring a vast collection of artifacts from ancient civilizations.

Day 3:
Explore **Trafalgar Square** and visit the **National Gallery** (open from 10 am), which houses a world-class collection of Western European art, including works by Van Gogh, Monet, and Leonardo da Vinci.

Which of these options appeals to you? Or would you like me to suggest more attractions?
