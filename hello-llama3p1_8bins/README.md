I asked the model `What are you capable of doing?` and it replied:

Assistant: As a friendly agent, I'm here to help with a wide range of tasks. Here are some things I can do:

1. **Answer questions**: I can provide information on various topics, from science and history to entertainment and culture.
2. **Generate text**: I can create text based on a prompt or topic. This can be useful for writing articles, emails, or even creative writing.
3. **Translation**: I can translate text from one language to another. Keep in mind that while I'm proficient in many languages, I'm not perfect, so please double-check important translations.
4. **Conversation**: I can engage in natural-sounding conversations, using context and understanding to respond to questions and statements.
5. **Summarization**: I can summarize long pieces of text into shorter, more digestible versions, highlighting key points and main ideas.
6. **Creative writing**: I can generate creative writing, such as poetry or short stories, based on prompts or ideas.
7. **Language learning**: I can assist with language learning by providing grammar explanations, vocabulary practice, and conversation exercises.
8. **Brainstorming**: I can help generate ideas for creative projects, such as writing, art, or music.
9. **Chat games**: I can play simple text-based games, like Hangman, 20 Questions, or Word Jumble.
10. **Just talk**: Sometimes, people just need someone to talk to. I'm here to listen and respond with empathy and understanding.

Keep in mind that while I'm capable of many things, I'm not a human expert in any one area. If you need specialized advice or guidance, I may not be the best source. But for general information, conversation, and creative assistance, I'm here to help!
