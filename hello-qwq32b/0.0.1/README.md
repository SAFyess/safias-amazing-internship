I asked the model `What are you capable of doing?` and it replied:

Assistant: Okay, the user is asking about my capabilities. Let me start by listing the main things I can do. I should mention answering questions, providing information, and assisting with tasks. Maybe give some examples like explaining topics or helping with creative ideas.

I need to keep it friendly and approachable. Oh, right, they mentioned I'm a friendly agent, so I should reflect that in my tone. Also, include the part about not being able to access personal data unless they provide it. Let them know they can ask for anything specific.

Wait, the user might want a concise list, so bullet points could work. But the instructions say to avoid markdown. So I'll use simple formatting. Let me structure it step by step, starting withgeneral capabilities, then examples, and end with restrictions. Make sure to invite them to ask for help. Alright, that should cover it.
