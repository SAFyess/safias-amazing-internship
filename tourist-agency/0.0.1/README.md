# Tourist Agency 

I asked the `tourist-agency`model what can I do for 3 days in `Tetouan` and it replied:

### **3-Day Itinerary for Tetouan, Morocco**

#### **Day 1: Explore Tetouan‚Äôs Historical Medina**
Tetouan is the only city in Morocco with a *Moorish-Andalusian medina* (UNESCO-listed). Start here:

- **Bab Ohenna (Gate of Warmth)**: Begin your visit at the main entrance to the medina, a stunning gateway symbolizing the city‚Äôs Andalusian roots.
- **Souks & Artisan Workshops**: Wander through the bustling markets (Leather Souk, Souk el Attarine) and watch artisans crafting intricate woodwork, silver jewelry, and zellige mosaics. Don‚Äôt miss the tanneries for an authentic textile-dyeing experience.
- **Kasbah Museum (Dar el Makhzen)**: Explore the restored palace-turned-museum showcasing Moroccan artifacts, textiles, and art.
- **Archaeological Museum**: Learn about ancient Roman ruins in nearby Lixus and local history.
- **Andalusian Garden**: A peaceful spot to rest, surrounded by orange trees and fountains.
- **Art Nouveau House (Dar Zerguib)**: Admire the blend of Andalusian and Moroccan architecture in this historic home, known for its jewel-toned tilework.

**Evening**: Dine at **Patisserie Bouhofine** (local pastries) or a rooftop restaurant in the medina for pastilla and mint tea. End with sunset views from the **Spanish Quarter (Villa San Miguel)**.



#### **Day 2: Day Trip to Chefchaouen (The Blue City)**
Chefchaouen is **1 hour by car** from Tetouan. Use private transport or a shared taxi.

- **Explore the Blue Medina**: Wander the striking indigo-painted streets, relax in **Plaza Uta el-Hammam**, and visit the **Kasbah Museum** (views of the Rif Mountains). Climb to the **Spanish Mosque** at sunset for panoramic views.
- **Hike or Dine**: If feeling adventurous, walk to **Akchour Waterfalls/Allah‚Äôs Bridge** (15‚Äì20 min from Chefchaouen). Alternatively, enjoy lunch at a casual caf√© serving msemen (Moroccan flatbread) or tagine.
- **Return to Tetouan** by evening for a quieter night.

**Optional Alternative**: If you have more time, visit **Hoceima National Park** (2+ hours from Tetouan) for mountain landscapes and hiking trails, but Chefchaouen is more accessible for a day trip.



#### **Day 3: Nature & Local Culture**
Choose between a coastal or mountain escape based on your interests:

**Option 1: Rif Mountains & Dayet Aoua Lake**
- **Talassemtane National Park**: Drive into the Rif Mountains to see cedar forests, wildflowers, and remote villages like Azla (visit a **women‚Äôs argan oil cooperative**).
- **Dayet Aoua**: A dramatic glacial mountain lake (1.5‚Äì2 hours from Tetouan) surrounded by trails. Great for photos and a lakeside picnic.

**Option 2: Beach & Coastal drive**
- **Martil Beach**: The closest sandy beach to Tetouan, ideal for a relaxed morning. Visit **Platja Blanca**, a white-sand beach with clear waters.
- **Tangier Day Trip** (optional): If you have more time, head to Tangier (1.5 hours) to visit **Cap Spartel Lighthouse** and **Hercules Cave** before returning.    

**Back in Tetouan**:
- **Take a Cooking Class**: Learn to make Moroccan dishes like pastilla or harira at a local kitchen (e.g., **Tetouan Cultural Center**).
- **Shopping**: Buy argan oil, handicrafts, or traditional thob (long dresses) at Souk El Had.



### **Pro Tips**
- **Transport**: Use taxis/rental cars (book in advance for day trips). Shared taxis (grand taxi) to Chefchaouen cost ~60‚Äì80 MAD per person.
- **What to Wear**: Modest clothing in the medina; hiking shoes for mountains or coastal areas.
- **Language & Currency**: Arabic and Darija (Moroccan Arabic) are common. Spanish is also spoken here (Tetouan was a Spanish protectorate). Use Moroccon Dirham (MAD).
- **Local Eats**: Try **msemen with amlou (almond dip)** for breakfast, and **tea at Caf√© Clock** (global Moroccan fusion) if open.
- **Safety**: Tetouan is safe, but keep valuables secure in crowded areas.

**Bonus**: If visiting on a Thursday, don‚Äôt miss **Souk el Beraza** (weekly agricultural market) for local produce and textiles.
